### Research Experience
* 2016–2017 Research Assistant at Brno university of technology
         * Babel Project: Funded by IARPA
         * Analysis of real-world recorded speech from various languages. Developed robust and efficient acoustic
          modeling method and played an active role in performance improvement of the existing systems
* 2017–present LORELEI Project: Funded by DARPA
   * Developing a low cost speech recognition system for zero/low resource languages using Bayesian methods
         and WFST techniques. Direct pipeline from speech to text by extracting unsupervised acoustic units and
          mapping it to their corresponding phonemes followed by word segmentation
